JSON parsing with JsonReader
============================
This is a demo for parsing JSON in Android using [JsonReader](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/JsonReader.html). It parses sample data and loads it into a table layout on the screen. This project was created for [Parsing JSON with JsonReader](http://kahdev.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/android-parsing-json-with-jsonreader/).

The project is configured to use API level 15 (4.0.3).
